            <h2>Guidelines for a vegan lifestyle</h2><br>
            <section><p>A vegan diet is a diet that removes animal products. Animal products include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meat (beef, chicken, lamb, etc)</li>
                    <li>Seafood (fish, shellfish, etc)</li>
                    <li>Dairy (milk, cheese, cream, etc)</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following foods are also considered animal products and some vegans exclude them from their diet
                    as well:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Honey</li>
                    <li>Gelatine (used as an ingredient, typically in desserts)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section><p>Due to these restrictions, a vegan diet is based on eating primarily plant foods, including
                vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds. It also includes eating products manufactured from plants
                that are suitable for vegans such as vegan meat and cheese, soy, and alternative milks.</p>
                <p> Vegan diets are different from vegetarian diets. Vegetarian diets only remove certain categories of
                    animal products. Typically, vegetarians will not eat meat and fish, but will eat other products like
                    dairy and eggs.</p></section>
            <section><p>Transitioning to a vegan diet requires swapping animal products for plant-based equivalents.
                Some easy swaps you can make in recipes include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of meat, you can use tofu, beans, chickpeas or lentils. These still provide the protein
                        and bulk you would be accustomed to from meat.
                    </li>
                    <li>When baking, there are many substitutes based on what the original purpose of the egg was. For
                        binding, use soaked chia seeds or soaked flaxseed meal. For moisture, use mashed banana or fruit
                        puree. For creaminess, use peanut butter, non-dairy yoghurt or soft tofu.
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead of scrambled eggs, use hard tofu.</li>
                    <li>Instead of milk, switch to a plant milk. There are many different varieties available: soy, oat,
                        rice, coconut, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead of butter, use margarine or oil. A fruit puree can also be used in a baking recipe.</li>
                    <li>Instead of cheese, use nutritional yeast or tofu.</li>
                    <li>Instead of cream, use plant milks, coconut cream, margarine, oils.</li>
                    <li>Switch chocolate, yoghurt and other sweet dairy foods for dairy-free versions. These can be made
                        using a plant milk or cream. Chocolate that is 100% cocoa is also dairy-free.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section><p>A vegan diet is a good way to lower the carbon emissions of your diet. Animal products generate
                more emissions because of the land, food and water required to raise livestock as well as transporting
                livestock between locations. See our Carbon Emissions Calculator to know the number of emissions
                generated by various foods, including animal products.</p></section>

            <h2>Nutrition: what you need to know </h2> <br>
            <section>
                <p>Some vitamins and minerals can be harder to get on a vegan diet. This is because nutrients like
                    protein, iron and calcium are most often found through animal products. But most nutrients can also
                    be
                    found in plant foods, and vegans can supplement nutritional gaps through using supplements.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Protein</b>: To get all 9 essential amino acids found in protein, it is important to eat a
                    variety of plant foods containing protein. This includes legumes, nuts, seeds, soy, wholegrains, and
                    cereals. You can have an adequate amount of protein by eating a combination of some of these foods
                    every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Iron</b>: There are many plant foods that contain iron including wholegrains, legumes, tofu,
                    leafy
                    green vegetables, and dried fruit. However, it is harder for the body to process iron from plant
                    foods,
                    so when eating one of these foods you should eat a food with vitamin C (such as a fresh fruit or
                    vegetable) to help absorb the iron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Vitamin B12</b>: This is the hardest nutrient for vegans to get from their diet, as there are no
                    natural plant sources of it. Some brands of soy drinks or vegetarian sausages/burgers may contain
                    B12, but you need to check the label and ensure the products are vegan. It is advised that vegans
                    (and some vegetarians) take B12 supplements.
                </p>

<!--            <section>-->
                <p>
                <b>Zinc</b>: Plant sources of zinc include nuts, tofu, legumes, wholegrains, wheatgerm and miso.
            </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Calcium</b>: Foods like leafy dark green vegetables (kale, bok choy, broccoli, etc), legumes,
                    almonds and tahini naturally contain calcium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Iodine</b>: The easiest way for a vegan to get iodine is from a small amount of iodised salt each
                    day. Iodine can also be found in seaweed, bread that contains salt, or in supplements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Omega-3 Fats</b>: There are only a few foods that provide a particular omega-3 fat named ALA, but
                    you
                    only require a small amount of one of these foods each day. These include chia seeds, walnuts, hemp
                    seeds, ground flaxseed, or an oil from any of these foods. Two other omega-3 fats, DHA and EPA, can
                    be
                    converted in the body if you have enough ALA. You can also buy supplements for DHA and EPA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Vitamin A</b>: There are no natural sources of Vitamin A in plants, however leafy green and
                    orange vegetables contain elements that the human body can convert to Vitamin A. Eating some of
                    these foods every day will ensure adequate Vitamin A levels.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This is a summary of what foods you should eat each day to adequately get all the nutrients you
                    require: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leafy green vegetables and orange vegetables</li>
                    <li>Fruit</li>
                    <li>Wholegrains</li>
                    <li>Soy (if you are not allergic)</li>
                    <li>A small amount of chia seeds/hemp seeds/ground flaxseeds/walnuts</li>
                    <li>A small amount of iodised salt</li>
                    <li>A Vitamin B12 supplement</li>
