                <br>
                <section style="margin-top: 20px"><p>A vegan diet is a diet that removes animal products. Animal products include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meat (beef, chicken, lamb, etc)</li>
                        <li>Seafood (fish, shellfish, etc)</li>
                        <li>Dairy (milk, cheese, cream, etc)</li>
                        <li>Eggs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The following foods are also considered animal products and some vegans exclude them from their
                        diet
                        as well:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Honey</li>
                        <li>Gelatine (used as an ingredient, typically in desserts)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to these restrictions, a vegan diet is based on eating primarily plant foods, including
                        vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds. It also includes eating products manufactured from
                        plants
                        that are suitable for vegans such as vegan meat and cheese, soy, and alternative milks.</p>
                    <p> Vegan diets are different from vegetarian diets. Vegetarian diets only remove certain categories
                        of
                        animal products. Typically, vegetarians will not eat meat and fish, but will eat other products
                        like
                        dairy and eggs.</p>
                    <h3>Easy vegan food swaps</h3>
                    <p>Transitioning to a vegan diet requires swapping animal products for plant-based equivalents.
                        Some easy swaps you can make in recipes include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Instead of meat, you can use tofu, beans, chickpeas or lentils. These still provide the
                            protein
                            and bulk you would be accustomed to from meat.
                        </li>
                        <li>When baking, there are many substitutes based on what the original purpose of the egg was.
                            For
                            binding, use soaked chia seeds or soaked flaxseed meal. For moisture, use mashed banana or
                            fruit
                            puree. For creaminess, use peanut butter, non-dairy yoghurt or soft tofu.
                        </li>
                        <li>Instead of scrambled eggs, use hard tofu.</li>
                        <li>Instead of milk, switch to a plant milk. There are many different varieties available: soy,
                            oat,
                            rice, coconut, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Instead of butter, use margarine or oil. A fruit puree can also be used in a baking
                            recipe.
                        </li>
                        <li>Instead of cheese, use nutritional yeast or tofu.</li>
                        <li>Instead of cream, use plant milks, coconut cream, margarine, oils.</li>
                        <li>Switch chocolate, yoghurt and other sweet dairy foods for dairy-free versions. These can be
                            made
                            using a plant milk or cream. Chocolate that is 100% cocoa is also dairy-free.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A vegan diet is a good way to lower the carbon emissions of your diet. Animal products
                        generate
                        more emissions because of the land, food and water required to raise livestock as well as
                        transporting
                        livestock between locations. See our Carbon Emissions Calculator to know the number of emissions
                        generated by various foods, including animal products.</p>

                <section style="margin-top: 20px">
                    <p>Some vitamins and minerals can be harder to get on a vegan diet. This is because nutrients like
                        protein, iron and calcium are most often found through animal products. But most nutrients can
                        also
                        be
                        found in plant foods, and vegans can supplement nutritional gaps through using supplements.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Nutrients that can be found in plant foods</h3>
                    <b>Protein</b>: To get all 9 essential amino acids found in protein, it is important to eat a
                    variety of plant foods containing protein. This includes legumes, nuts, seeds, soy, wholegrains,
                    and
                    cereals. You can have an adequate amount of protein by eating a combination of some of these
                    foods
                    every day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Iron</b>: There are many plant foods that contain iron including wholegrains, legumes, tofu,
                        leafy
                        green vegetables, and dried fruit. However, it is harder for the body to process iron from plant
                        foods,
                        so when eating one of these foods you should eat a food with vitamin C (such as a fresh fruit or
                        vegetable) to help absorb the iron.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Omega-3 Fats</b>: There are only a few foods that provide a particular omega-3 fat named ALA,
                        but
                        you
                        only require a small amount of one of these foods each day. These include chia seeds, walnuts,
                        hemp
                        seeds, ground flaxseed, or an oil from any of these foods. Two other omega-3 fats, DHA and EPA,
                        can
                        be
                        converted in the body if you have enough ALA. You can also buy supplements for DHA and EPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Zinc</b>: Plant sources of zinc include nuts, tofu, legumes, wholegrains, wheatgerm and miso.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Calcium</b>: Foods like leafy dark green vegetables (kale, bok choy, broccoli, etc), legumes,
                        almonds and tahini naturally contain calcium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Vitamin A</b>: There are no natural sources of Vitamin A in plants, however leafy green and
                        orange vegetables contain elements that the human body can convert to Vitamin A. Eating some of
                        these foods every day will ensure adequate Vitamin A levels.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nutrients that will require supplements</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Vitamin B12</b>: This is the hardest nutrient for vegans to get from their diet, as there are
                        no
                        natural plant sources of it. Some brands of soy drinks or vegetarian sausages/burgers may
                        contain
                        B12, but you need to check the label and ensure the products are vegan. It is advised that
                        vegans
                        (and some vegetarians) take B12 supplements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Iodine</b>: The easiest way for a vegan to get iodine is from a small amount of iodised salt
                        each
                        day. Iodine can also be found in seaweed, bread that contains salt, or in supplements.
                    </p>


                    <h3>What to eat to get all your required nutrients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leafy green vegetables and orange vegetables</li>
                        <li>Fruit</li>
                        <li>Wholegrains</li>
                        <li>Soy (if you are not allergic)</li>
                        <li>A small amount of chia seeds/hemp seeds/ground flaxseeds/walnuts</li>
                        <li>A small amount of iodised salt</li>
                        <li>A Vitamin B12 supplement</li>
                    </ul>
