# Eco-eat Project
This project is designed for Monash University FIT5120/5122 IEPP units.

## Project Background
Since the 2000s, Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in response to the growing risks posed by climate change. With the greenhouse effect, the average temperature at the surface of the Earth is rapidly increasing. In Australia, the research shows around 14% of the greenhouse gas is produced by food and 6% are caused by food waste. The research also shows that certain diets, such as a plant-based diet, can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 

Target on vegan and environment concerned people in Australia, we are here to help our users learn about how to help the environment by only change their food habits. By given suggestions on the vegetarian recipes, comparing carbon emissions from different ingredients, exploring fantastic environment-friendly restaurants for our users, we aimed to lead our users gradually turns to live an environment-friendly lifestyle.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Victorian adults are becoming increasingly aware of how daily actions have an impact on the environment and want to make changes that can reduce this impact. If they are medically able to, they may specifically change their diet. However, they may not have access to information on how to make these changes. They might require guidance on the various choices they can make in terms of ingredients they consume, restaurants they go to or recipes they cook. They also would want to know what kind of environmentally friendly diet may be most suitable for them: a diet that includes animal products but swaps certain ingredients to reduce carbon emissions, or a diet that reduces or removes animal products.


## What in this project 
In this project we have three iteration planned. For the first iteration, we build a emission calculater which will calculate users input food's carbon emission breakdowns. And also a short tips page, which include some handful environment friendly suggestions. 

In iteration two, we enable to build a map view, wich shows some vegan restaurant in Victoria region and can be edxtended to other states once the data allowed.

For the third iteration, we planned to develop some menu comparasion features, which can compare different menus with their nutreints and ingredients.
